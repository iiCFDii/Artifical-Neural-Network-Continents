The modifiable variables in the code are located in the main function and are as follows: 

thresh - Threshold variable
lr - Learning Rate variable
conv - Convergence variable

For best Results I set thresh to be 0.3, lr also to be 0.3 and conv at 0.14.

If you would like to initialize your own weights from a txt file, simply follow the prompts when running the program

The format of the next file to initialize weights should be as follows: 

0.45
0.4567
0.894
0.789
...

etc 

You should store all 20 weights in one colomn, In order of the countries lat/long as such: 

Africa , America, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific

I included a file of my best stores weights, but you have to organize them into the list as shown above.


This program was written in c++, and as such, when trying to read in text make sure it is in the same folder as the proejct being run.
I used visual studio to compile and run the code.
